# Companion Application

This is the companion application to be run on a laptop or desktop running Linux, Mac, or Windows. It submits the parameters of your requests to the Ledger Hardware Wallets, which will then display the information for confirmation.

It is important to use the Ledger's display as the source of truth when confirming transactions as it is much more secure than your laptop or desktop and a compromised version of this application could be running.
